# MicroHack Documentation

Run a [MicroHack](https://github.com/microsoft/MicroHack) ([Offical Website](https://www.microsoft.com/de-de/techwiese/events/microhacks/default.aspx)) hackathon with the Hackathon Console.

> [!NOTE]
> **7+ hacks are supported.** There are some unsupported hacks (~4), that are linked ones or incomplete.


## Prerequisites
 - Powershell 7+
 - Azure Az Module
 - Git
 - Azure Subscription
 - Bicep installed ( https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/install#install-manually )
 - This repository cloned (``git clone https://github.com/qxsch/HackboxConsole.git``)

## Execution Steps

1. Choose a hack
   ```pwsh
   .\documentation\MicroHack\chooseMicroHack.ps1 | Format-Table Name, RelativePath, HackVariants
   ```

1. Prepare the environment for the chosen hack
   ```pwsh
   .\documentation\MicroHack\chooseMicroHack.ps1 -HackName "04_BCDR_Azure_Native"
   ```

1. Create the Hackathon Console Users (in this example, we prepare logins for 4 teams with a single coach for each team)
   ```pwsh
   .\iac\createUsers.ps1 -numberOfTenants 4
   ```

1. Deploy to Azure
   ```pwsh
   # we use -doNotCopyChallengesOrSolutions, because the above steps already copied everything to the right place
   .\iac\deployHackerConsole.ps1 -doNotCopyChallengesOrSolutions
   ```

1. Check the users.json file for the logins of the teams and coaches

1. $\color{#D29922}\textsf{\Large\kern{0.2cm}\normalsize(Optional)}$ In case you want to run it within pre-built environments:
   1. Weeks before the Event
      1. Create the lab users:
         ```pwsh
         $startDate = Get-Date "2025-12-12 08:00"
         $stopDate =  Get-Date -Date $startDate.addDays(2) -Hour 16
         # create the users in Entra ID
         # if you have a No Mfa group, add f.e. -additionalGroupnames @("NoMfaEnforcement") to the command below
         .\iac\azure\createEntraIdUsers.ps1 -hackathonStartDate $startDate -hackathonEndDate $stopDate
         ```

      1. Publish the user credentials to the Hackathon Console:
         ```pwsh
         # select the appropriate subscription for the management resources
         Select-AzSubscription -SubscriptionId "management"
         # deploy the Hackathon Console
         Get-Content .\createdEntraIdUserSettings.json | ConvertFrom-Json | .\iac\addMultipleCredentails.ps1
         ```

      1. Prepare the quota requests (if applicable):
         > [!IMPORTANT]  
         > Do not forget to edit the csv file, in case you host multiple teams per subscription!!

         ```pwsh
         # submitting the quota requests from the csv file
         .\iac\azure\prepareQuotaRequests.ps1 -labDirectory C:\path\to\directory\lab\quota-requests.csv
         ```

   1. Multiple Days before the Event
      1. Deploy the lab environments:
         ```pwsh
         # for a resource group based deployment (multiple teams per subscription)
         .\iac\azure\deployLabEnvironments.ps1 -labDirectory C:\path\to\directory\lab\ -managementGroupId "labsubscriptions" -subscriptionPrefix "traininglab-" -deploymentType "resourcegroup" -teamsPerSubscription 4
         # or for subscription based deployments
         .\iac\azure\deployLabEnvironments.ps1 -labDirectory C:\path\to\directory\lab\ -managementGroupId "labsubscriptions" -subscriptionPrefix "traininglab-" -deploymentType "subscription"
         ```
      1. Test if everything is working as expected (resources got deployed, ...)

   1. After the Event
      1. Delete the lab environments:
         ```pwsh
            # for a resource group based deployment (multiple teams per subscription)
            .\iac\azure\destroyLabEnvironments.ps1 -labDirectory C:\path\to\directory\lab\ -managementGroupId "labsubscriptions" -subscriptionPrefix "traininglab-" -deploymentType "resourcegroup"
            # or for subscription based deployments
            .\iac\azure\destroyLabEnvironments.ps1 -labDirectory C:\path\to\directory\lab\ -managementGroupId "labsubscriptions" -subscriptionPrefix "traininglab-" -deploymentType "subscription"
            # as an alternative you can also delete all the resource groups
            .\iac\azure\removeAllResourceGroupsFromSubscriptions.ps1 -managementGroupId "labsubscriptions" -subscriptionPrefix "traininglab-"
         ```

      1. Delete old user accounts (if any):
         ```pwsh
         # delete old users
         .\iac\azure\deleteEntraIdUsers.ps1 -purgeUsers
         # remove orphaned role assignments
         .\iac\azure\removeOrphanedRoleAssignments.ps1 -includeResourceGroups
         ```
